        <h2>Norway and Iceland Trip, Summer 2025</h2>
        </p>
        <p>Chris and I escaped the extreme NC heat to see the beautiful landscapes of Norway and Iceland. Along with
            Chris’s
            brother Tim, his wife Kim, and her sister Jane, great travelling companians, we signed up for a Viking Ocean
            cruise,
            with a pre-trip to Oslo and train ride from Oslo to Bergen.

            Below is a day-by-day summary of the trip. The most interesting photos are later on, so feel free to skip
            text and jump
            around. If you click on a photo, you will get the full image and can scroll through the images in that
            “block,” using
            the direction keys if on a laptop. Hit escape to return to the blog. In some sections there are multiple
            blocks of
            photos under the same text. I create these blogs as a way to help me remember key details of trips, and to
            put in
            context some of my favorite photos. I also love sharing the experience with friends and fellow travellers
            from different
            trips we have taken.</p>

            <p>Friday, June 27

                We arrived in Oslo after an Icelandair flight from RDU to Reykjavik, ate breakfast in the airport, and
                boarded the next
                flight to Oslo. Our hotel, the Radisson Blu, was centrally located, by the train station/mall and a
                short walk to the
                waterfront. Pizza and bed were all our jetlagged bodies could handle after we dumped our bags in the
                room.

                Saturday, June 28

                <span><strong>We had a morning tour of Oslo, which included a visit to a viking museum (the main museum
                        was closed for renovations),</strong></span>
                and my favorite sculture park. At the museum we had a demonstration of the methods of viking
                shipbuilding, using
                overlapping planks of wood; and saw a model of an actual viking ship which had been excavated from land
                — it was a
                burial ship, which would have housed a body and key possessions of the dead.
